# Perfect Fifths

This was me trying to find out if a frequency of 2:3(1:1.5) would loop back round on itself within an octave (1:2). The answer is no, it does not loop back around but I think I'm not understanding what the ratios are because I am not the most versed in music theory.

The main value of this is the Fraction struct, I had been wanting to make one for a long time and here was finally an excuse to have a type with perfect precision (well, up to u128, when I make a big ints struct I'll try using that in here).
